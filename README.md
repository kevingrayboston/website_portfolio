## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML. CSS


## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Optimization for this could come in the form of better targeting for CSS that uses ess classes.

## Lessons Learned:

These sample websites were excercises to gain a master of CSS using the float method. Some of the key lessons learned here was to about how to approach work in terms of spreading resources (i.e. time and effort) across the distribution of tasks is important. Additionally, I also learned the importance of create responsive design for all devices.
